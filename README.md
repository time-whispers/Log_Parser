# Log_Parser

A log management system must first parse the files to extract meaningful information from logs. Log parsing translates structured or unstructured log files so your log management system can read, index, and store their data. This way, you can easily filter, analyze, and manipulate the key-value information.

One of the most commonly used structured data formats is JSON. Itâ€™s the first choice for many application developers because its Unicode encoding makes it universally accessible and readable by humans and machines alike. The snippet below shows a simple JSON document with key-value pairs as elements.
